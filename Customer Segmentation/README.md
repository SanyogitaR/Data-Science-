# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to segment customers using **unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)** in Python. It provides visual and practical insights that can help businesses with **targeted marketing**, **personalization**, and **customer relationship management**.

## 📌 Objective

Segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographic and purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering.

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset contains **2240 entries** and **29 features** including:
  - Marital Status
  - Income
  - Spending Score
  - Education
  - Kidhome, Teenhome
  - Year of enrollment
  - Various product purchase details

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Dropping nulls and duplicates
   - Encoding categorical data
   - Scaling features

2. **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters

3. **K-Means Clustering** for unsupervised customer segmentation

4. **Visualization** of clusters using PCA for dimensionality reduction

## 🧪 Results

- Optimal clusters: **4**
- Each cluster represents a unique customer group with different traits and shopping habits
- Visualizations highlight how customers differ by income, age, product interests, etc.



## 💼 Use Cases

- 🎯 Targeted Marketing Campaigns
- 🛍️ Personalized Recommendations
- 📈 Business Intelligence Dashboards
- 💬 Tailored Customer Engagement Strategies
